# HK Challenge Mode

A mod that adds Challenge Mode from Enter the Gungeon to Hollow Knight. Each boss arena in Godhome now has randomly selected **modifiers** that make the game more challenging in a variety of ways, such as spawning enemies, adding a new mechanic to juggle, disabling or nerfing certain attacks, etc. The further the player gets in a pantheon, the more modifiers there are. Certain bosses will have unique modifiers. The mod works in both Pantheons and Hall of Gods.
